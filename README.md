## Solution for Bounty #5

### Files
- `n8n-workflow.json` - Exportable n8n workflow

### Setup Instructions
1. Import `n8n-workflow.json` into your n8n instance
2. Configure the GitHub node with your personal access token
3. Set the workflow parameters: `repoOwner`, `repoName`, `emailFrom`, `emailTo`, and `language`
4. Configure the Email node with your SMTP settings
5. Activate the workflow and set the cron trigger to run weekly

### How It Works
1. Weekly cron trigger fires (Friday at 5pm by default)
2. Fetches commits, closed issues, and merged PRs from GitHub API for the past week
3. Constructs a prompt with this data and sends it to Claude API (claude-sonnet-4-20250514)
4. Claude generates a narrative summary in the configured language (EN/FR)
5. Summary is delivered via email to the configured recipient

### Configuration
- Repository owner and name
- Email sender and recipient addresses
- Summary language (EN/FR)
- Weekly trigger schedule

### Testing
The workflow has been tested on a real n8n instance and successfully generated a weekly summary.
